Code of Conduct
---------------

Metalab is an inclusive community where everyone is welcome regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion – to discuss and learn more about technology in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement. We want all participants to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Therefore, all participants are expected to be nice and respectful towards each other.

To clarify what is expected of participants, everyone in Metalab is obliged to follow this code of conduct. It applies at the Metalab premises and to all of Metalabs physical meetings, events and the like, as well as all communication channels and other virtual activities.

We strive to provide a fun, educational and friendly atmosphere in the club.

* Think about what you say. Remember that sexist, racist and other exclusionary comments – including jokes – can be offensive to those around you. They are not suitable for Metalab.

* Be nice to each other. Do not insult or act in a derogatory manner towards any participant. Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave Metalab immediately.

* Harassment includes offensive or unwanted comments about (for example) gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity or religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwanted photographs or recording, sustained disruption of talks and inappropriate physical contact.

* Participants who are asked to stop their inappropriate behaviour or their harassment are expected to do so immediately.

* If you observe a participant displaying improper behaviour, you should contact Metalab immediately. The contact persons may be found here. All complaints to Metalab will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated and dealt with appropriately.

* Metalab is aware of its responsibilities as a public and inclusive hackerspace. If an incident were to occur, Metalab will give an apology to the offended party and future actions will be taken to make sure this does not reoccur.

* Any or all of the following countermeasures are to be expected: the alleged offender may be requested to change their behaviour. If the behaviour continues, the alleged offender is to immediately leave the site and can be prohibited from visiting Metalab and Metalab events.
